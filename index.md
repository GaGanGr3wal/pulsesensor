# Pulsesensor
## Pulse rate sensor for breathalyzer
# Week 7
This week we had to have our PCB working and successfully booted up. Once booted it <br>
the sensors should be plugged in and working after running a program on the Raspberry Pi.<br>
All my sensors were successfully working, and my LED also flashed.<br>
<br>
There was a problem with my memory card at first with my Raspberry Pi,but after installing <br>
the latest version of Raspbian,everything was working fine.I ran the "i2cdetect -y 1" command,<br>
it showed the sensors being recognized.<br>
<br>

# Week 6
By this week I updated my progress report that states all the things we have <br>
gone through from week 1 until now(which is seen below) and I also just recently <br>
completed soldering my PCB board and will go onto testing it.<br>
<br>

# Week 5
By this week we had to have ordered our parts needed for this project. All the parts <br>
that are still on their way need to at least have their proof of purchase.<br>

## Proof of purchase for Heartbeat Sensor:

# Week 2
We got our quiz back and we handed in the proposal.<br>
-   [Proposal for Heartrate Sensor](https://github.com/N01150244/pulsesensor/blob/master/ProposalContentKarandeepSinghRev02.docx)
# Week 1
In week one we did a tech quiz and decided on different sensors related to our software application.
